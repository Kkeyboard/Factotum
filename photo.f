:cyanotype [event]
:"       [process]
#        Iron-salts are applied to paper and then dried in the dark.
-        This produces sensitized paper. Placing an object on the paper
-        and exposing it to the sun will fix a silhouette against a
-        brilliant blue background, water washing can then be used as a fixer.
"        invented in: 1842
"        invented by: Sir John Herschel.
#
#        In a typical procedure, equal volumes of an 8% (w/v) solution of potassium ferricyanide
-        and a 20% solution of ferric ammonium citrate are mixed. This mildly photosensitive
-        solution is then applied to a receptive surface (such as paper or cloth) and allowed
-        to dry in a dark place. Cyanotypes can be printed on any surface capable of soaking
-        up the iron solution. Although watercolor paper is a preferred medium, cotton, wool
-        and even gelatin sizing on nonporous surfaces have been used. Care should be taken
-        to avoid alkaline-buffered papers which will cause degradation of the image over time.
#
#        A positive image can be produced by exposing it to a source of ultraviolet light
-        (such as sunlight) with a negative. The UV light reduces the iron(III) to iron(II).
-        This is followed by a complex reaction of the iron(II) complex with ferricyanide.
-        The result is an insoluble, blue dye (ferric ferrocyanide) known as Prussian blue.
#
#        Upon exposure to ultraviolet light (such as that in sunlight), the iron in the
-        exposed areas will reduce, turning the paper a steel-grey-blue color. The extent of
-        color change is dependent on the amount of UV light, but acceptable results are usually
-        obtained after 10-20 minute exposures on a bright, sunny day. The highlight values
-        should appear overexposed as the water wash will reduce the final print values. Prints
-        can be made with large format negatives and lithography film, or everyday objects
-        can be used to make photograms.
#
#        After exposure, developing of the picture involves the yellow, unreacted iron
-        solution being rinsed off with running water. Although the blue color darkens
-        upon drying, the effect can be accelerated by soaking the print in a 6% (v/v)
-        solution of 3% (household) hydrogen peroxide. The water-soluble iron(III) salts
-        are washed away, while the non-water-soluble Prussian blue remains in the paper.
-        This is what gives the picture its typical blue color.
#
#        The overall contrast of the sensitizer solution can be increased with the addition
-        of 1% (w/v) solution potassium dichromate. Approximately 6 drops for every 2-ml of
-        sensitizer solution.

:"       [process]
"        invented around 1822
"        invented by Niépce
#        The process used bitumen,(naturally occurring asphault), as a coating on glass
-        or metal, which hardened in relation to exposure to light -- long, eight hour, exposure.
-        When the exposed plate was washed with oil of lavender, only the hardened image area remained. 
-        The exposed plate was then acid etched and printed. [WP]
"        problem: \(resolution awful)
"        problem: \(very long exposure times)
"        problem: \(final printing difficult)
"        advantages: \(mutiple prints possible)
